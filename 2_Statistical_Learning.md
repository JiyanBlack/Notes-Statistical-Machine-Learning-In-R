# Introduction to R

## Matrix and Indices
* Create vector: a = c(1,2,3,4,5) or a <- 1:5
* length(a) --> length of vector / num of elements in matrix
* ls() --> list all objects in memory
* rm(x), rm(list=ls()) --> remove objects x, remove all objects
* help: ?funcname
* create matrix: matrix(data=1:100, nrow=10, ncol=10, byrow=T)
* rnorm() --> generates a vector of random normal variables
* cor(x,y) --> the statistical correlation between x and y
* set.seed(num) --> set random seed to a particular value, rnorm will always generate the same vector every time.
* mean(vector), var(vector), sd(vector) --> the mean, variance, standard deviation of the vector
* seq(a,b length=n) --> create an vector from a to b, length is n
* outer(x,y,function) --> perform the function to generate a outer join matrix
* A = matrix(1:16,4,4), A[2,3], A[1:3,2:4], A[1:2,], A[,1:4]
* A[-1:2,] --> negative value means detele the cooresponding row
* rep(value,rownumber) --> produce repreat value vector.

## Ploting data
* plot(x,y, xlab="x label",ylab="y label", main="sample graph")
* generate pdf:
```r
pdf('filename.pdf')
plot(x,y,col='green')
dev.off()
```
* contour(x,y,z, nlevels=45) --> contour plot
* image(x,y,f) --> heat map
* persp(x,y,z,theta=15,phi=15) --> 3d plot
* plot(Dataframe$column1, Dataframe$column2) --> selecting columns
* hist(singleVector, col='red',breaks=15) --> draw histogram

## Loading Data
* Auto = read.table('relative path', header=T) --> read a file into a dataframe
* fix(Auto) --> display data in a new window
* names(Auto) --> display column names
* attach(Auto) --> attach auto's columns to the name space
* cylinders = as.factor(cylinders) --> convert quantitative values to the qualitative values
* summary(Auto), summary(mpg) --> produce a summary of the data.
* rownames(dt_variable) = dt_variable[,1] --> set the row name as the first column, do not take part in the data processing.


# Exercises
1. Q1:
  a. flexble statistical learning method is better.
  b. inflexible method.
  c. flexible method.
  d. inflexible.
2. Q2:
  a. regression, inference
  b. classification, prediction
  c. regression, prediction
3. Q3:
  variance: increase, more flexibility, more changes for different datasets, more variance
  bias: decrease
  Bayes error: constant
  training error: decrease, as more flexibility always fits better
  test error: u-shape, sum of bias, variance and Bayes.
4. Q4:
    * for each commercial item, predict whether its going to be sold out or not.
    * predict whether a human has some disease.
    * predict that whether a stock is worth buying or not.
5. Q5:
  1. Flexible method: can fit to more complex data, more accurate for training data. But overfitting and data intepretation are the main issues for flexible method. When we have few data but many features, or we want to inteprete data, we may do not want a flexible method.

6. Q6: parametric: before learning, the form of f needs to be specified by human. Non-parametric: generate paras by machine.  
Parametric: need less data, can be intepreted. Non-parametric: can produce more accurate fit if data are enough.

7. Q7:   
  a. 3,2,sqrt(10),sqrt(5),sqrt(2),sqrt(3)  
  b. Green, sqrt(2) is smallest  
  c. 2,sqrt(2),sqrt(3) are the three nearest neighbours, is red,green,red, so the result is red.  
  d. small, because small k value will produce more complex boundaries.  

8. Q8:
```r
#8
summary(college)

pairs(college[,1:10])

attach(college)
Private = as.factor(Private)
plot(Private,Outstate)

Elite = rep('No',nrow(college))
Elite[Top10perc > 50] = 'Yes'
Elite = as.factor(Elite)
college = data.frame(college,Elite)
summary(Elite)
plot(Elite,Outstate)

hist(Apps, breaks = 100)
hist(Accept, breaks = 100)
hist(Enroll, breaks = 100)
hist(Accept/Apps, breaks = 100)

```

 6. To predict mpg, the weight, acceleration, horsepower,cylinders are very important. Because through the
 plot, we can see that mpg has negative correlations with horsepower, weight, has positive relationship with
 acceleration.
