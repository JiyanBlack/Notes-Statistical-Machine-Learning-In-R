# Simple Linear Regression

## Least Squares Method
* Most common method.
* Difference between y and y(predict) is called residual
* Residual sum of squares(RSS) is the sum of squared residuals
* Least Squares Approach aims to choose parameters that minimize RSS.

## Assesing the accuracy of coefficients estimates
* Population Regression Line: the deal best approximation to the true relationship between X and Y.
* Least Squares Line: the actual approximation produced by least squares method.
* Bias/unbiased estimator: an unbiased term does not systematically over-or-under-estimate the true parameter.
* Var(miu) = SE(mu)^2 = sigma^2/n
